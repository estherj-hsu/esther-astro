## Esther

Hi, I’m Esther from Taiwan 🇹🇼, a front-end developer with a UX background, currently based in Vancouver 🇨🇦.

I build user-centred, accessible web interfaces ♿✨ and care a lot about how things *actually* feel and behave. My roots are in CSS 🎨 and UI work, which means I tend to think about layout, structure, and interaction details before worrying about clever abstractions. If something looks fine but feels wrong to use, I will notice 👀.

I started teaching myself HTML and CSS at 16, mostly out of curiosity and stubbornness. Back then, it never felt like “programming” — it felt more like design with rules. That perspective stuck. Even now, I care deeply about semantics, visual hierarchy, and interaction behaviour, not just whether the code works.

In 2022, I moved to Vancouver to formally study User Experience Design, which gave language and structure to things I’d been intuitively doing for years. These days, I work at the intersection of design and development, focusing on clean front-end code 🧩, predictable keyboard interactions ⌨️, and accessibility that holds up in real products, not just guidelines 📐.

I’ve worked on projects for museums 🏛️, libraries 📚, NGOs 🌱, and public institutions across Canada. I like collaborative environments, thoughtful constraints, and the quiet satisfaction of interfaces that don’t get in the user’s way.
