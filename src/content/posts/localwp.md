<Esther>
Recently started to work on WordPress (again) 🙈  
Found a perfect tool for macOS to build WordPress without AMP (Apache+MySQL+PHP)

</Esther>

--------------------------

[LocalWP](https://localwp.com/) is totally FREE and can install more than one WordPress with it.  
Besides the local WordPress, it has many other features (which I don't really need).  
I used LocalWP to build projects in local environment and after it's done, I migrated everything to the production with [All-in-One WP Migration](https://wordpress.org/plugins/all-in-one-wp-migration/).  
It became extremely easy to work on all WordPress projects now with these 2 tools.  
Time flies and technology changes.  
Remember the old times, I had to install LAMP to build a local environment for WordPress and deal with all those version conflict problem... 🥲
