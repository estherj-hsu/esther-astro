I didn’t plan to migrate my site again.  
But at some point, maintaining it started to feel heavier than writing. 😮‍💨

I originally chose Hugo because it was stable and well-structured.  
It worked well for writing and organizing content.  
But over time, the site slowly turned into Markdown mixed with a lot of HTML and shortcodes, which made the content harder to maintain.

I explored a few other options along the way, including **Sveltia**, **Decap**, **Publii**, and **Ghost**.  
I also briefly tried adding a CMS layer, but it quickly felt unnecessary for how I actually use this site.

What I wanted to keep was simple: GitHub hosting, with the flexibility to customize both pages and the blog, without introducing extra tooling to maintain.

**Astro** felt like a better fit for keeping content and layout loosely coupled, without adding more abstraction ✨

The hardest parts of this migration were:

- Converting Hugo shortcodes 🧩
- Figuring out how to migrate with minimal changes, without rewriting the whole theme 🧱
- Summary handling (Hugo `more` vs Astro) ✂️

Many problems were not technical, but about deciding what to keep and what to let go.

For now, the goal was to get everything working again with a clean structure.  
Next, I’m planning to re-theme the site and clean up some old decisions 🎨
