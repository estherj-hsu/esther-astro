<Esther>


I’ve been meaning to clean up my portfolio site for a while, and finally did a small re-theme recently.

This wasn’t a full redesign.  
More like adjusting things so the site reflects how I work *now*.

</Esther>

--------------------------

### What changed 🧩

- Updated the site title to **“Esther: Version History”**  
  It feels closer to how I think about work: iterative, cumulative, never really finished.
- Simplified colours, typography, and layout with accessibility in mind ♿
- Cleaned up navigation, meta info, and OG previews 🔗

Small changes, but they make the site feel calmer and more intentional.

--------------------------

### Portfolio updates 💼

I updated the portfolio page to include some of the more recent projects I’ve been working on at work, and restructured it to separate **Featured Personal Projects** from client-facing **Front-End Projects**.

It feels clearer now, both for myself and for anyone browsing the work.

### Featured personal projects 🛠️

- [**Everyday Accessibility**](https://estherj-hsu.github.io/everyday-a11y/)  
  A practical accessibility reference focused on real UI patterns and implementation details.
- [**Trivia Taiwan**](https://estherj-hsu.github.io/trivia-taiwan/)  
  A project sharing interesting facts about Taiwan, built with care around structure and accessibility 🇹🇼

Both are things I actively work on and learn from, so it felt right to give them proper space.

--------------------------

Still very much a work in progress, by design. 🔁
