It has been a while since the last update.  
The good news is I got the invitation to IEC and will obtain a one-year open work permit. 🥳

--------------------------

I was busy with the application for The School of Interactive Arts and Technology (SIAT) at SFU in the last few months.  
There's Project-Based Master's Program that I'm interested in, and it also would be an alternative for me to staying in Canada.  
After working on the application and IELTS test, I somehow got the invitation for IEC(the working holiday visa).  
So... I filed my application for the one-year working permit and now actively looking for opportunities (again).  
Since I don't need any sponsorship this time, hopefully, I will get the job I like soon.

Besides the applications, I started assisting a local NGO to redesign and rebuild its website last December.  
It's still ongoing, but I think I can finish the case study soon.

All the best to me. ♥️
