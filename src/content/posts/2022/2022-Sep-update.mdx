I am in the term break recently.  
So glad that I finally finished my study for UX Design and can focus on job hunting now. 🤞  
Came up an idea for my side project: Trivia Taiwan 🇹🇼

--------------------------

I decided to enroll IxFD for further training in UX Design.  
Just finished "The Practical Guide to Usability" and "User Experience: The Beginner’s Guide", and keep learning now.  
My plan is to finish the Frontend Developer courses first then the UX Designer courses.  
Also enrolled the "Indigenous Canada" on Coursera, since I am quite interested in the history of Indigenous here.  
Learning distracts me a bit (from job hunting), and learning new things is always good.  
Learn! Learn! Learn!

Regarding Trivia Taiwan, it's a small website introducing all those interesting facts about Taiwan.  
As a Taiwanese, I really want to introduce the lovely small country to the world in an interesting way.
