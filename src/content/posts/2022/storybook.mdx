Built a Storybook playground for me 🥳  
Can't wait to create my own component library!

--------------------------

## Step by step

1. Get a react project first!  
  [minimal-react-webpack-babel-setup](https://github.com/rwieruch/minimal-react-webpack-babel-setup)

2. Add Storybook into the project  
```
npx storybook init
```

3. Fly!  
```
yarn storybook
```

### Troubleshootings

Got this error during adding Storybook into the project

```
The engine "node" is incompatible with this module. Expected version "^10.13.0 || ^12.13.0 || ^14.15.0 || >=15.0.0". Got "12.12.0" error Found incompatible module.
```

Change the node version by nvm

```
nvm --version
nvm install 12.13.0
```
