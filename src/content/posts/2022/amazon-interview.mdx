After the phone screening, I got an interview chance with *Amazon AWS*.  
Only about 10 days to prepare for it, and finally, it’s today!

--------------------------

### Phone Screening

I applied for three positions I found attractive on Amazon at the end of May.  
Honestly, I didn't expect them to reply that soon.  
And had the phone screening in early June, they invited me for the official interview after a few days.  
Then I received a link to provide the date and time that I will be available.  
After a week, I finally got the confirmed date and time of the interview.  
I think Amazon's job site is better compared to Apple and Microsoft. 🤔  

PS. I also got a chance to have a phone screening with Apple. However, they turned me down in 10 mins right after they heard I can't work full time now. (And said that I could reach out once I get my PR. 🤷🏻‍♀️)

### The Preparation
Since I was told that there'd be both behavioural and technical questions, I spent lots of time on preparation.

- Studied Amazon Leadership Principles,
- wrote down all the cases I could think about for behavioural questions,
- watched many JS interviews on YouTube,
- even tried some leetcode problems.

### Prep Call
The recruiter of Amazon is really helpful.  
He asked me to book a "Prep Call" after I got the confirmed date of the interview.  
I didn't really know what's that, but I just booked an appointment with him and made the call 3 days before the interview.  
He shared some tips with me and also talked about the interview process.  
And recommended I watch some videos on Inside Amazon (Amazon Job Offical Youtube Channel).  
I have to say; those videos helped me a lot.


### D-Day
For the interview, Amazon uses "Chime."  
Since I had some bad experiences with Google Meet, I decided to attend 15 mins earlier.  
Somehow on Chrome, it couldn't detect my camera and on Firefox it couldn't detect my headphone.  
So I had to download and install the desktop app.  
Chime didn't support background filters, so I had to ensure my background was clean.

The interviewer was a little bit late (about 2~3 mins), and there was a shadow interviewer with us.  
He reviewed my resume and we talked about my previous position and daily routine at first.  
Then after about 10 mins, we jumped into coding directly.

1. CSS and HTML: how to make the text in the center of an image element.
2. JS: nodeTree to HTML: write a function to draw nodeTree into HTML
3. JS advanced: HTML to nodeTree: reverse what we did on Q2

After solving each problem, he asked if I have another solution for them.  
Also, he was supportive and provided tips for me when I met problems or paused.  

About 5 mins before 1 hour, he asked me if I had any questions for him.  
I asked about the skill they are looking for and also about my background without CS.  
The overall interview experience was pretty nice.  
I did my best and let's... follow the flow.
