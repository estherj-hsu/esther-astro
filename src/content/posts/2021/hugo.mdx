Finally... Hello Hugo! Bye Hexo!

</Esther>


--------------------------

#### Step 1. Install Hugo
Install hugo and create a new site. 👏👏👏

#### Step 2. Setting
Find the theme I prefer and set up `config.toml`.  
I choose "zozo" for now. (*might* build my own theme in the future...)  

#### Step 3. Move files
Moving hexo posts & pages from hexo to hugo.
The title format is different...😭

#### Step 4. Style
Since there're some customized styles on pages, I need to make those customized style to hugo too.  

#### Step 5. Github w/ Actions
The hardest step.😞🤯😵  
I created 2 repo on github and set one as private for hugo files and the other one as public for ghpage.  
There're several problems I got:

 1. The short code error
 2. Submodule path error
 3. Actions deploy all folders
 4. Forgot to update `baseUrl`

Finally, everything is done!!!!!!!!!! 🎉  
Let's start my hugo life.
